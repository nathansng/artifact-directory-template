Title:
FinDL: A Deep Learning Library for Finance Applications

Abstract:
Time series data has gained much attention in numerous fields of scientific research and industry. With time series data available in almost any field, researchers and practitioners are able to extract different features and information from time series data to utilize in a variety of real-world applications. Deep learning models have also achieved great success and proved their validity and impact in time series forecasting tasks, finding great success in tasks such as predicting future stock trends. However, developing effective deep learning models for time series forecasting tasks requires an extensive amount of machine learning knowledge, which may be a barrier for financial specialists who lack this expertise. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinDL, a library designed for both financial specialists and machine learning engineers. FinDL provides an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for time series data, with out-of-the-box models that can be configured and fine-tuned according to the users' requirements. With this library, users can easily create and deploy machine learning models for finance-related tasks.
